# Hangman
Description:
This game is the traditional hangman game.  It was made with my two nephews in mind as the target audience so there is a childish theme to it.  The game uses the background image as a clue for the word and at the end of the round a picture of the character is shown with the full answer.  It uses functions to take a keystroke and compare the letter of the key pressed to the answer and then places that letter in a new array at all the correct spots.

Deployment:
This is a web based program so it will not require any additional programs to operate.  It was designed with Google Chrome as the default browser.

Purpose of Hangman:
The purpose of the program was to incorporate many elements of javascript.  It uses DOM to place dashes, correct guesses, incorrect guesses, pictures, and a score in the html code.  It uses objects to keep all of the information about the words organized: the word, picture of the word, universe the word is a part of.

Also in this repository:
There are psychic.html and psychic.js files in this repository as well because it was the alternate, easy-version of the hangman assignment.  I started with psychic and then moved onto hangman, therefore the psychic program is not complete.  There is no link to psychic from the Hangman game.
